A chrome extension

### What is the bookmarklet?
Are.na's [bookmarklet](https://www.are.na/tools/bookmarklet) allows you to add information to are.na from your browser bar while you are out and about surfing the net.

### What is this Chrome Extension?
Well, it's the bookmarklet. But instead of it being added to the bookmarks bar, it's in the form of a Chrome Extension. Now you can keep your bookmarks bar hidden while still collecting. Yay extensions!
